# oAuth Bridge

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/preferans/oauth-bridge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/preferans/oauth-bridge)

A library focused on API Authentication for Phalcon applications.

The main goals of this project:
- To provide transparent integration using oAuth industrial standards
- To provide better performance by working with Phalcon Framework
- To reduce inconvenience resulting from the lack of [PSR-7](www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) support in Phalcon Framework (prior to v3.x)
